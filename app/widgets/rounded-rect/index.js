/*
This is a dumb widget. It has no awareness of maximum value or current level of achievement.
Its size is determined only by its width and height in pixels. It is the responsibility of calling code to determine the appropriate size.

The widget could be made smarter by giving it awareness of the maximum value it should be able to represent, and the current value it should indicate.
The widget's .width would then specify its size when its current value was at maximum. Lesser values would result in narrower visible image,
although the widget's .width would remain unchanged.

This example has been deliberately kept simple to demonstrate how to create a widget that is basically just a collection of SVG elements.
